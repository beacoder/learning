learning Ruby

0.Philosophy
Ruby follows the principle of "least astonishment", and offers myriad ways to do the same thing.

1.Symbol
Symbols are simply constant names that you donâ€™t have to predeclare and that are guaranteed to be unique.
A symbol literal starts with a colon and is normally followed by some kind of name: walk(:north), look(:east)

e.g:
inst_section = {
  :cello  => 'string',
  :violin => 'string'
}

inst_section = {
  cello:  'string',
  violin: 'string'
}

inst_section[:cello] # => "string"

2.Blocks
Code blocks are just chunks of code between braces or between do and end.
All you can do with a block is associate it with a call to a method.
The method can then invoke an associated block one or more times using the Ruby yield statement.

e.g:
def who_says_what
  yield("Dave", "hello")
  yield("Andy", "goodbye")
end
who_says_what {|person, phrase| puts "#{person} says #{phrase}"}

3.Object attributes
Ruby provides a shortcut for creating these simple attribute-reading/attribute-setting methods.

class BookInStock
  attr_reader   :isbn
  attr_writer   :price
  attr_accessor :price # accessor => allow read and write

  def initialize(isbn, price)
    @isbn = isbn
    @price = Float(price)
  end
end

book = BookInStock.new("isbn1", 33.80)
puts "ISBN  = #{book.isbn}"
puts "Price = #{book.price}"
book.price = book.price * 0.75 # discount price
puts "New price = #{book.price}"

4.Iterator
A Ruby iterator is simply a method that can invoke a block of code.
Within the method, the block may be invoked using the yield statement.

e.g:
def two_times
  yield
  yield
end
two_times { puts "Hello" }

animals = %w( ant bee cat dog )      # create an array
animals.each {|animal| puts animal } # iterate over the contents

Enumerator object (External iterators) can be created by calling the to_enum method
on a collection such as an array or a hash.

e.g:
a = [ 1, 3, "cat" ]
enum_a = a.to_enum
enum_a.next # => 1

Most of the internal iterator methods will also return an Enumerator object if called without a block.

e.g:
a = [ 1, 3, "cat" ]
enum_a = a.each # create an Enumerator using an internal iterator
enum_a.next     # => 1
