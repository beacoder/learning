1.block
description:  Code blocks are defined by their indentation.
              By "code block", I mean functions, if statements, for loops, while loops, and so forth.
              Indenting starts a block and unindenting ends it.
              
exp:
def fib(n):                   
    print 'n =', n            
    if n > 1:                 
        return n * fib(n - 1)
    else:                     
        print 'end of the line'
        return 1

2.control structures

if statement: 
              if ... :
                  ... 
              elif ... :
                  ...
              else :
                  ...
    
while statement:
              while ... :
                     ...
              else :
                     ...
                     
for statement:
              for ... in ... :
                   ...
              else :
                   ...
                   
break statement:  if you break out of a for or while loop, 
                  any corresponding loop else block is not executed.
                  
              for ... in ... :
                   break
              else :
                   ...

continue statement: used to skip the rest statements in the current loop block,
                    and continue to the next iteration of the loop.
                    
              for ... in ... :
                   ...
                   continue
                   ...
              else :
                   ...
