1.block
description:  Code blocks are defined by their indentation.
              By "code block", I mean functions, if statements, for loops, while loops, and so forth.
              Indenting starts a block and unindenting ends it.
              
exp:
def fib(n):                   
    print 'n =', n            
    if n > 1:                 
        return n * fib(n - 1)
    else:                     
        print 'end of the line'
        return 1

2.control structures

if statement: 
              if ... :
                  ... 
              elif ... :
                  ...
              else :
                  ...
    
while statement:
              while ... :
                     ...
              else :
                     ...
                     
for statement:
              for ... in ... :
                   ...
              else :
                   ...
                   
break statement:  if you break out of a for or while loop, 
                  any corresponding loop else block is not executed.
                  
              for ... in ... :
                   break
              else :
                   ...

continue statement: used to skip the rest statements in the current loop block,
                    and continue to the next iteration of the loop.
                    
              for ... in ... :
                   ...
                   continue
                   ...
              else :
                   ...
                   
3.scope of variables
Local:  variables declared inside a block (function or class) is local to the block.
Global: varialbes defined at the top level of the program (not inside any functions or classes).

How to access Global Variable inside a function ?
use 'global' to create a local reference to the global variable and operate on the reference.

exp:
              x = 50
              def func():
                  # 'global x' => reference the global x
                  global x
                  print('x is', x)
                  x = 2
                  print('Changed global x to', x)
              func()
              print('Value of x is', x)
              
output:
              x is 50
              Changed global x to 2
              Value of x is 2
