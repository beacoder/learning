1. How to run a script ?

Generate byte-code  :
script code -> pre-process -> compile -> byte-code (similar to assemble code)

Run script  :
use script interpreter to run(interprete) the byte-code.

Note: 'interpret' means finding the right "assemble / machine" code 
      corresponding to the byte-code and run it.

2. How to run a compiled program ?

Generate Executable program :
source code -> pre-process -> compile -> assembler -> link -> executable code (machine code)

Run program :
just run it.

3. Pros and Cons of script and compiled language ?

Script:   develope efficiency is great, runtime efficiency is bad. 
          used to do quick prototyping, write components which need contant change.
          usually have a big convenient 3rd-party libs: CPAN, PyPI, RubyForge.
Compiled: develope efficiency is bad, runtime efficiency is great.
          used to write performance critical components, such  as important algrithoms.
